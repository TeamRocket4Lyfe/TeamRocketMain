## Workflow
Create a branch off master with your name in it. When you have finished a project, please open a pull request between your branch and master, and Victoria or Sean (binary or ;) ) will look over it before accepting the pull request. Victoria will also check Sean's PRs, and Sean will check Victoria's.
